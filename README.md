# My Free Code Camp projects

This repository holds all the programs or scripts that I made to complete the tasks given
by [FreeCodeCamp]("https://www.freecodecamp.org").

| Course | Task | Link |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Responsive Web Design | Tribute Page | [:arrow_forward:]("https://codepen.io/kode-logger/full/yLbOMGw") |

I will be updating the page as soon as I finish the other tasks.

Until then, stay tuned and feel free to check out my solutions.
